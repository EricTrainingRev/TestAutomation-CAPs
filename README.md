# Purpose
This Repo is intended to store Bounties for the Test Automation "Competency Assessment Points" (CAPs). Any Bounties you create should be listed in the rubric-automation markdown file and include the Bounty name, type of activity, length of activity, and possible amount of CAPs that can be earned.

The hope is this repository will provide a central location for trainers to be able to utilize and add activities that anyone teaching an automation batch can use to help gauge associate competency levels while also providing helpful hands-on activities for the associates to build their skills in a practical way. Please reach out to Adam Ranieri if you wish to be added as a collaborator to this repo, or if you have any suggestions/ideas for it.
